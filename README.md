# cloudPaper
there are some sources in here too


I am dumping all the resources in here, though I'm not sure this isnt a violation of IP laws.

My vision for this collaboration is as follows.

Set up an outline of the paper
Set up a bunch of short-answer questions within the outline
Go through and answer some or all of the short answer questions
Add supporting paragraphs and unify the whole paper.

I would also like to build a very simple implementation, as proof of concept. Frankly I don't know how this will really work. I imagine there will be some code written in SOL, hosted on the ethereum blockchain and a step by step process of fetching keys, encrypting, and uploading. A human oeprator can perform all the steps of the process and document them, and just leave the possibility that this process could be automated.
